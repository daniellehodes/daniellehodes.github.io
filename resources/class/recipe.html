    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 fryer chicken, 2½ to 3 pounds, cut into 8 pieces</li>
        <li>Flour for dredging</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dredge the chicken pieces heavily with flour, salt, and pepper. Let stand on a rack for 30 minutes or
            longer.</li>
        <li>Melt ½ to ¾ inch of lard in a skillet, and when it is very hot, brown the chicken pieces quickly on all
            sides. Do not crowd the pan. If necessary, brown a few pieces at a time and transfer to a platter lined with
            paper towels in a 300 degrees F oven while you continue cooking.</li>
        <li>When all the chicken is browned, arrange in the skillet, reduce the heat, and cover. Allow to cook for 20 to
            25 minutes. After 10 minutes, rearrange the pieces to bring the white meat to the top; and after 15 to 20
            minutes, remove the white meat to a hot platter and keep warm.</li>
        <li>When all the chicken is done, remove from the pan and pour off all but 1 tablespoon of fat. Add the cream
            mixed with the egg yolks and stir over low heat till thickened; do not allow to boil. Season to taste. Pour
            over the chicken and serve at once.</li>
